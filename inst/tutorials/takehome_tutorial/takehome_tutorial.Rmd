## Welcome

This document contains a series of exercises to practice what you learned in your [_Carpentries_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) workshop.See the link for the lesson materials.



### Table of Contents

In this tutorial, you will practice how to:

* R Basics: read data into R, access subsets, plot data
* Create Functions
* Analyze Multiple Datasets
* Using if/else statements



## Getting Started with R

### Load the data

There are many ways to load data. While we will not use this dataset today, it is useful to know how to load a dataset directly from GitHub. See below for loading an example Tidy Tuesday dataset. Run the code to confirm that it was properly loaded.

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
measles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/measles.csv')


head(measles)

# Using global assignment to use in subsequent exercises

assign("measles", measles, envir=globalenv())
```

###

Now go ahead and use the below codeblock to inspect the data and answer the questions below. 

```{r loaddata2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r q1, echo = FALSE}
question(" What are the dimensions of the dataframe?",
         answer("62342 x 20"),
         answer("10293 x 21"),
         answer("66113 x 16", correct = TRUE),
         answer("70493 x 15"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### 

```{r loaddata3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r q1a, echo = FALSE}
question(" What function do you use to view only the columnnames?",
         answer("cols()"),
         answer("colnames()", correct = TRUE),
         answer("columnnames()"),
         answer("namecols()"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### 

```{r loaddata4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r q1b, echo = FALSE}
question(" What does the function str() tell you?",
         answer("column names, value preview, dimensions, number of null values"),
         answer("column names, column types, number of null values"),
         answer("column names, column types"),
         answer("column names, column types, value preview, dimensions, classes of object", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

```{r loaddata5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r q1c, echo = FALSE}
question(" What's the shortcut to print a value after variable assignment in your console if you didn't want to type print(new_value)?",
         answer("(measles_copy <- measles)", correct = TRUE),
         answer("measles_copy <- measles"),
         answer("View(measles_copy <- measles)", message = "Technically this opens it up in your viewer window, not your console"),
         answer("print(measles_copy <- measles)", message = "Close! However, there's an even faster alternative"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###


```{r loaddata6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r q1d, echo = FALSE}
question(" What's the class of the object measles and the class of",
         answer("(measles_copy <- measles)", correct = TRUE),
         answer("measles_copy <- measles"),
         answer("View(measles_copy <- measles)", message = "Technically this opens it up in your viewer window, not your console"),
         answer("print(measles_copy <- measles)", message = "Close! However, there's an even faster alternative"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```



##  indexing Dataframes

Use the below exercise box to answer the polls below: 

```{r index1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```




```{r indexq1, echo = FALSE}
question(" What value is in the 10300th row in the 13th column?",
         answer("2.33"),
         answer("2", correct = TRUE),
         answer("NA"),
         answer("Arizona"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

```{r index2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

    <div id="index2-hint">
    **Hint:** Remember you can use the column numbers in the index to see the three values at once
    </div>
    
```{r indexq2, echo = FALSE}
question(" What values in the 50th row for columns titled 'state', 'year', and 'enroll'?",
         answer("Arizona, 2017-18, 85"),
         answer("Arizona, 2018-19, 94"),
         answer("Arizona, 2017-18, 80"),
         answer("Arizona, 2018-19, 73", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

```{r index3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r indexq3, echo = FALSE}
question(" How would you print the 700th row and all columns except the last and second to last column? (Pick all that apply)",
         answer("measles[-15:-16, 700]"),
         answer("measles[700, 1:14]", correct = TRUE),
         answer("measles[700, -15:-16]", correct = TRUE),
         answer("measles[1:14, 700]"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

## Using Functions on Subsets

```{r fn1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r fn1q, echo = FALSE}
question(" What is the min and max of the column 'mmr'?",
         answer("10,99"),
         answer("1, 95"),
         answer("0, 90"),
         answer("-1, 100", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

```{r fn2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r fn2q, echo = FALSE}
question(" Use the summary function to find the quartiles and mean for the xper, lat and lng columns. What are the mean values for each column?",
         answer("7, 38.2, -94.34"),
         answer("6.78, 39.15, -96.28", correct = TRUE),
         answer("5.36, 40.21, -89.97"),
         answer("8.20, 38.23, -90.36"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


###

This next question will combine concepts of subsetting and the function apply().

Next, print the unique values listed in the state and county columns together using the apply function and c() function. 

Feel free to try out the unique() function on any column to preview what it does.


```{r apply_fn, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

    <div id="apply_fn-hint">
    **Hint:** Be mindful of if you are applying the function across rows or columns. Remember 1 is across rows and 2 is across columns.
    </div>

```{r apply_fn-solution}

apply(measles[,c(2,7)], 2, unique)

```

###  

## Creating Functions

In the code block below, create a function titled 'count_unique' that will count the number of unique values for a specified column.

You should use the following steps:

1. Assign a variable that contains all unique values for that column with the unique() function.
2. Use the length() function to count the number of values in the variable you created in step 1.

```{r createfnq1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}



```


```{r createfnq1-solution}

count_unique <- function(col_name) {
  unique_values <- unique(col_name)
  
  length(unique_values)
}

```

###

```{r usefn1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}



```

```{r usefn1q, echo = FALSE}
question(" Using the function you created above, how many unique cities are there in the dataset?",
         answer("5666", correct = TRUE),
         answer("604"),
         answer("2317"),
         answer("9503"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###


```{r usefn2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}



```

```{r usefn2q, echo = FALSE}
question(" Using the function you created above, how many unique cities are there in the dataset?",
         answer("5666", correct = TRUE),
         answer("604"),
         answer("2317"),
         answer("9503"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

Now create a second function titled 'count_na' that calculates the number of NA's in each column.

First, use the is.na() function around a specific column. 
Second, use the sum() function to count the number of values that return TRUE. (If the logical value returned is TRUE, that means there is an NA and therefore we should count it.)

```{r usefn3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}



```

```{r usefn3-solution}

count_na <- function(col_name) {
  sum(is.na(col_name))
}

```


```{r usefn3q, echo = FALSE}
question(" Using the function you created above, what are possible function calls to find the number of NA values for the 'city' column? (Select all that apply)",
         answer("count_na(measles$city)", correct = TRUE),
         answer("count_na(measles[6,]"),
         answer("count_na(measles[,6])", correct = TRUE),
         answer("count_na(measles['city'])", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


###

```{r usefn4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

print_col <- function(colname) {
  print(colname)
}

count_col_na <- function(colname = city) {
  print(colname)
}

count_unique_val <- function(colname = measles$state) {
  unique_val <- unique(colname)
  length(unique_val)
}

print_unique <- function(colname) {
  colname <- measles$state
  unique(colname)
}


```

```{r usefn4q, echo = FALSE}
question(" Of the functions above, which one correctly passes an argument as a default? (Select all that apply)",
         answer("print_col"),
         answer("count_col_na"),
         answer("count_unique_val", correct = TRUE),
         answer("print_unique"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


When you place a logical test inside of `filter()`, filter applies the test to each row in the data frame and then returns the rows that pass, as a new data frame.

Our code above returned every row whose month value was equal to one _and_ whose day value was equal to one.


## Boolean operators

### &, |, and !

R uses boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into a single logical test. These include `&` (_and_), `|` (_or_), `!` (_not_ or _negation_), and `xor()` (_exactly or_). 

Both `|` and `xor()` will return TRUE is one or the other logical comparison returns TRUE. `xor()` differs from `|` in that it will return FALSE if both logical comparisons return TRUE. The name _xor_ stands for _exactly or_.

Study the diagram below to get a feel for how these operators work.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question(" What will the following code return? `filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)`",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December", message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December"),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.", message = "The next section will say a little more about combining tests."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Be sure to write oue a _complete_ test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###  

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

###  

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
    filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
    ```

###  

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you should use them later.

###  

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

## Missing values

### NA

Missing values can make comparisons tricky in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing or unknown values. `NA`s are "contagious" because almost any operation involving an unknown value (`NA`) will also be unknown (`NA`). For example, can you determine what value these expressions that use missing values shoudl evaluate to? Make a prediction and then click "Submit Answer".

```{r nas, exercise = TRUE, evaluate.exercise = FALSE}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
```

```{r nas-check}
"In every case, R does not have enough information to compute a result. Hence, each result is an unknown value, `NA`."
```

### is.na()

The most confusing result above is this one:

```{r}
NA == NA
```
